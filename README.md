 A folksonomy web of ideas. The idea behind this service (currently just a readme as documentation) came from a combination of a few ideas:

1. Twitter, but a minimum word count (maybe 100?) I need to research this. But, a platform for writing and sharing ideas in a conversation with others, ideally organized with a folksonomy for additional creator driven hierarchy and meaning.

2. Medium, but more interconnected/linked and maybe shorter form? Like 2005ish blogging / Moveable Type. Make it easy to connect mini-essays to mini-essays, and tag other creators.

3. Question oriented. If you contribute below the minimum word count, you mush choose from a fixed set of questions (dropdown) to append in order to move the conversation forward.

4. Authentic, deep, and meaningful engagement methods in order to create more genuine conversations that support logic, compassion, and support. Clapping, etc from intrinsic motivation, to encourage intrinsic motivation (more research needed)

5. Choose Your Own Adventure - Interactive Conversational Interface: the journey map of interaction might look similar in the flowchart structure of a CYOA narrative pubication

6. Semantic and cited. In the spirit of Tim Berners-Lee, this should be primarily text based, informative, and show a web of distributed and collective knowledge that cites the original contributor. Version control is NECESSARY if edits are allowed (imagine github version control but for twitter edit button, longform)

7. Decorative where it adds meaning. A limitation of the original spirit of the WWW (a browser, html, css, js, a datastore) would be super rad.

8. The access, support, time, and privilege to make this idea real, all the way to the end, for once.

## I am new to github, ðŸ‘‹ hi

If you got here, hello! I am going to try to make this, maybe. If you have ideas for how I might do this, let me know! I love to talk.
